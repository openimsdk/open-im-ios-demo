OpenIM provides an open-source Instant Messaging (IM) SDK for developers, serving as an alternative solution to cloud services like Twilio and Sendbird. With OpenIM, developers can build secure and reliable IM applications similar to WeChat, Zoom, and Slack.

This repository is based on the open-source version of the OpenIM SDK, offering an iOS IM application. You can use this application as a reference implementation of the OpenIM SDK.

## Development Environment

Before you start development, ensure that the following software is installed on your system:

- **Operating System**: macOS 14.6 or later
- **Xcode**: Version 15
- **Git**: For version control

Additionally, make sure you have [deployed](https://docs.openim.io/zh-Hans/guides/gettingStarted/dockerCompose) the latest version of the OpenIM Server. After deployment, you can compile the project and connect it to your server for testing.

## Supported Platforms

This application supports the following platforms:

| Platform      | Version               | Status |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ------ |
| **iOS**       | 13.0 and above        | ✅     |

### Notes

- **iOS**: Make sure your version meets the requirements to avoid compilation issues.

## Quick Start

Follow the steps below to set up your local development environment:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-ios-demo.git
   cd open-im-ios-demo/Example
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pod install
   ```
   2.1 If the installation fails, execute the following command to update the local CocoaPods warehouse list.
   ```bash
   pod repo update
   ```

3. Modify the configuration

     > If you have not changed the default server ports, update only the [defaultHost](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-ios-demo/blob/948cb89c11e046a2928708d6f22e5ff213deb2fe/Example/OpenIMSDKUIKit/AppDelegate.swift#L21) to your server IP.

   ```swift
   let defaultHost = "your-server-ip or your-domain";
   ```

4. open OpenIMSDKUIKit.xcworkspace to compile and run the program.

5. Start developing and testing! 🎉

## Audio/Video Calls

The open-source version supports one-to-one audio and video calls. You need to first deploy and configure the [server](https://github.com/openimsdk/chat/blob/main/HOW_TO_SETUP_LIVEKIT_SERVER.md). For multi-party audio/video calls or video conferencing, please contact us at [contact@openim.io](mailto:contact@openim.io).
